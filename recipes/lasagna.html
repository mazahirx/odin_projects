    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its rich layers of pasta, savory meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese. Its origins trace back to ancient Rome, but the version most people recognize today developed in Naples during the Middle Ages. Traditional lasagna features alternating sheets of pasta with a hearty ragù made from ground beef or pork, tomato sauce, and spices, all topped with a generous amount of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. The dish is baked until golden and bubbling, creating a comforting, flavorful meal enjoyed worldwide.</p>
    <p>Modern variations of lasagna have expanded far beyond the classic meat-based recipe. Vegetarian versions often include ingredients like spinach, mushrooms, zucchini, and ricotta, while some recipes swap pasta sheets for vegetables such as eggplant or zucchini slices to create a low-carb alternative. Lasagna is also popular in frozen form, making it a convenient option for busy households. Whether served at a family dinner, holiday gathering, or casual get-together, lasagna remains a beloved staple that brings people together with its warm, hearty appeal.</p>
